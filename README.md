# Emulsion
Emulsion is a paint focused puzzle game built on the Portal 2 Source Engine branch.

# Setup
To setup emulsion, you must first create a gameinfo.txt. I did things this way to prevent shipping Portal 2's assets.
to setup the gameinfo.txt, go into game/emulsion, and locate "gameinfo.EDIT_ME_WITH_TXT_EDITOR". Follow the instructions inside this fie,
and save it as a "gameinfo.txt" in the same directory you found it. This will also need to be done for the skeleton template (game/skeleton), if it is used.

Have Fun!
