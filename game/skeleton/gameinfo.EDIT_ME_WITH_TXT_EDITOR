// LOOK HERE: when u finish adding the paths, save this file as gameinfo.txt. it's necessary for the game to run. 
// this file is listed in the gitignore, so it will not interfere with other people's gameinfos.
// I'm aware this is sorta jank, but since volt is needed at the momenet, we need to run standalone and |all_source_engine_paths|
